## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Summary

 In Summary , analysing the logistic regression model, it does a good job predicting healthy loans with a nearly 99% and 100% precision and recall respectively .
  Overall it is very accurate. As far as  high-risk loans it is slightly lower, but still trustworthy results, having high recall and still high f1-score .
